# Accessibility Report 

**1.** As a group, answer the following questions — place your answers in a file called accessibility-report.md in your group's GitHub repository:
For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which features of your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features, you can either:

**(a)** Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to the principle or

**(b)** Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.

- **Principle 1: Equitable Use**
  - 
  - Our signup and login supports emails and names of varying lengths and characters outside the english language.
  - Features we can implement for this principle include:
    - Adding languages settings for UI elements.
    - Implementing dark mode UI for those with visual conditions.
    - Settings to change UI elements size for visual preference and enhancement.
    - Text-to-speech option for those with visual impairment.


- **Principle 2: Flexibility in Use**
  - 
  - Currently, our UI element sizes are static and not very flexible in use.
  - Features we can implement for this principle include:
    - Windows size and UI element size adjustment for varying screen resolutions.
    - Narrations for each post and club information.
    - Implementing the app for a variety of operating systems.
    - Allowing keyboard navigation for the entire app.


- **Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use**
  -
  - We implemented easy to understand UI elements to navigate between views, including button icons and labels to 
    input fields.
  - Popups are used to relay when tasks succeed or fail, such as editing club descriptions and post making.
  - Features we can implement for this principle include:
    - Adding text labels for every button in the student home view.


- **Principle 4: Perceptible Information**
  - 
  - Our app is currently limited to only provide visual information.
  - Features we can implement for this principle include:
    - Windows size and UI element size adjustment for those with varying eyesight.
    - Provide text narration to relay club information using audio.
    - Cue sound effects when a task succeeds or fails.


- **Principle 5: Tolerance for Error**
  - Popups warn user of errors in our app, such as invalid emails during signup.
  - Features we can implement for this principle include:
    - Adding a warning popup before changing a club's description or removing a member.
    - Moving the logout button away from other buttons.
    

- **Principle 6: Low Physical Effort**
  - Navigation between different views are simple through mouse clicks.
  - The App doesn't require external inputs other than a mouse and keyboard.
  - Features we can implement for this principle include:
    - keyboard shortcuts for going between views.
    - Speech-to-text implementation for creating posts and filling text fields.


- **Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use**
  - This principle does not apply to our app, since this issue of size and space relates to the hardware accessibility 
    of a computer, not our app software.


**2.** Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category of users, such as "students", or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.

  Our app is specifically marketed towards University of Toronto students in all campuses. More specifically, 
  it is targeted towards students interested in an accessible platform to discover and join clubs. This provides an
  accessible way for students to find clubs outside club fairs. We will also market toward students using other
  social media apps for club information, especially for those whose home pages are filled from unrelated posts. The
  app is also targeted towards any student wanting to start their own club and want to keep their member's
  up-to-date with club activities and events.


**3.** Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. Your discussion here should be informed by the content of our embedded ethics modules this term.

Due to our app's concept, the app would not likely be used by any people who isn't a UofT student. Our app also isolates
those whose primary language isn't English since there's no language selection option. This is a
big concern because of the large proportion of international students at UofT. The app may be unusable if the user has
visual impairments, or if the user's monitor does not support the window size of the app because of the lack of
UI size adjustment.
