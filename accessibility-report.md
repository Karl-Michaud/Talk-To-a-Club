# Accessibility Report 

**1.** As a group, answer the following questions — place your answers in a file called accessibility-report.md in your group's GitHub repository:
For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which features of your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features, you can either:

**(a)** Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to the principle or

**(b)** Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.

- **Principle 1: Equitable Use**
  - 
  - Our signup and login supports emails and names of varying lengths and characters outside the english language.
  - Features we can implement for this principle include:
    - Adding languages settings for UI elements.
    - Implementing dark mode UI for those with visual conditions.
    - Settings to change UI elements size for visual preference and enhancement.
    - Narration for those with visual impairment.


- **Principle 2: Flexibility in Use**
  - 
  - Currently, our UI element sizes are static and not very flexible in use.
  - Features we can implement for this principle include:
    - Windows size and UI element size adjustment for varying screen resolutions.
    - Narrations for each post and club information.
    - Implementing the app for a variety of operating systems.
    - Allowing keyboard navigation for the entire app.


- **Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use**
  -
  - We implemented easy to understand UI elements to navigate between views, including button icons and labels to 
    input fields.
  - Popups are used to relay when tasks succeed or fail, such as editing club descriptions and post making.
  - Features we can implement for this principle include:
    - Adding text labels for every button in the student home view.


- **Principle 4: Perceptible Information**
  - 
  - Our app is currently limited to only provide visual information.
  - Features we can implement for this principle include:
    - Windows size and UI element size adjustment for those with varying eyesight.
    - Provide text narration to relay club information using audio.
    - Cue sound effects when a task succeeds or fails.


- **Principle 5: Tolerance for Error**
  - Popups warn user of errors in our app, such as invalid emails during signup.
  - Features we can implement for this principle include:
    - Adding a warning popup before changing a club's description or removing a member.
    - Moving the logout button away from other buttons.
    

- **Principle 6: Low Physical Effort**
  - Navigation between different views are simple through mouse clicks.
  - The App doesn't require external inputs other than a mouse and keyboard.
  - Features we can implement for this principle include:
    - keyboard shortcuts for going between views.
    - Speech-to-text implementation for creating posts and filling text fields.


- **Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use**
    - This principle does not apply to our app, 


**2.** Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category of users, such as "students", or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.

Since our game is heavily influenced by GeoGuessr (a similar location guessing game) the GeoGuessr audience would be a great place to start in terms of marketing as we have features of GeoGuessr plus additional features such as hints. Beyond that, anyone interested in guessing games, trivia or puzzle lovers would also greatly enjoy this game. Additionally, we can market this game towards schools to use in their geography class as a tool to introduce world geography, different landscapes, as well as a fun educational break from their scheduled curriculum. Since our hints feature educational content such as when the country was established and what language is largely spoken, it could be used as a learning tool in History class as well! Overall, our game has a large target audience, and users of all ages and skill levels can enjoy.


**3.** Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. Your discussion here should be informed by the content of our embedded ethics modules this term.
Without any of the changes specified above, this program is less likely to be used by users with mobility issues such as arthritiies, parkinsons, or carpal tunnel syndrome as our game is largely based on mouse clicks, and any hand tremors will largely affect your performance. Since our UI is largely Swing, our buttons are not very big and it would be frustrating to use if the user had such a mobility issue. Furthermore, users with vision issues would also be less likely to use our program as we dont have zoom on our swing GUI (we do on our JavaScript however). Another issue is people who are dyslexic or have other reading issues, may not use our program as we don't have the option to change fonts for the user's preference.
